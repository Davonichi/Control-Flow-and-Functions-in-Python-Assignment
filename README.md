# Control-Flow-and-Functions-in-Python-Assignment

Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """Calculates the final price after applying a discount if it's 20% or more."""
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        return price  # No discount applied


Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """Calculates the final price after applying a discount if it's 20% or more."""
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        return price  # No discount applied

# Get user input
price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate the final price
final_price = calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)

# Display the result
if final_price == price:
    print(f"No discount applied. The final price is: ${final_price:.2f}")
else:
    print(f"Discount applied! The final price is: ${final_price:.2f}")
